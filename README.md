## Some implementation details

* I chose to implement the requirements in C#, using VS2015
* I used the ASP.MVC template
* I used Ninject as dependency injector
* I used CsvHelper nuget package for parsing the .csv files
* I used AutoMapper for mapping between business objects and view models 
* I used NUnit + FakeItEasy (mocking framework) for unit testing
* I used bootstrap for a little bit of styling
* I created two separate pages (one for settled bet history and one for unsettled bets)
